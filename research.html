      The Effects of Extended Medicaid Postpartum Coverage on Insurance and Mental Health Outcomes<br>

          <p class="abstract-text">
           Despite the United States' high healthcare expenditure, maternal outcomes remain 
           significantly worse compared to other developed nations. The American Rescue Plan Act 
           (ARPA) of 2021 aimed to address this issue by allowing states to extend Medicaid postpartum 
           coverage from 60 days to 12 months. In an era dominated by sharp differences and party 
           ideology, most red and blue states moved quickly to adopt this extension. This paper evaluates 
           the effects of this policy change using high-frequency data from the Household Pulse Survey and 
           a staggered Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework. Our findings indicate that the 
           postpartum coverage expansion significantly increased Medicaid enrollment and reduced 
           uninsurance rates among women of childbearing age. Additionally, the policy led to notable 
           reductions in moderate to severe anxiety and depression, highlighting its positive impact on 
           maternal mental health. The results underscore the importance of continuous health insurance 
           coverage in improving maternal mental health.

       The Effects of Debt Relief on the Mental Health of Farmers<br>
      <em>With Sankar Mukhopadhyay</em><br><br>
      <span style="font-size:14px;">
        We use the quasi-exogenous variation from the farm debt relief programs established
   by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to estimate the effect of debt relief on 
   the mental health outcomes of the farmers in the U.S. Using high-frequency (monthly)
   nationally representative data from the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) and difference 
   in difference regressions we find that the IRA debt relief programs improved mental 
   health of farmers. Our preferred estimates suggest that among farmers anxiety decreased
   by 9.5% and depression by 9.0%. The effects are stronger among minority farmers. Anxiety
   decreased by 25.2%, and depression decreased by 28.0% among minority farmers. These 
   results suggest that the IRA debt relief had a positive effect on the mental health of 
   farmers, especially the minority farmers.

        Impact of Negative Life Events on Financial Risk Taking<br>

          <p class="abstract-text">
          This paper investigates whether traumatic life events—specifically, the loss of a 
          child—shape individuals’ willingness to engage in financial risk-taking.
          Using data from the 2004–2016 waves of the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS),
          we proxy risk preferences through observed portfolio decisions, focusing 
          primarily on stock market participation as an indicator of financial risk-taking 
          behavior. Our analysis reveals that individuals who have experienced the death of
          a child are less likely to invest in risky assets, suggesting the presence of a
          negative association between bereavement and financial risk-taking. However, while 
          the evidence points to a potential correlation, the relationship is not statistically
          definitive. These findings contribute to the broader literature on how deeply 
          personal and emotionally significant life shocks can influence economic 
          decision-making, highlighting the possibility that traumatic experiences may have
          persistent effects even in domains unrelated to the original event.
